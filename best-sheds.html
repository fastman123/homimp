They seldom use items should be at the back of the shed, where it takes a little effort to get to, and the regular use should be right up front where you need them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s surprising how much space you&rsquo;ll reclaim using this method - it also helps us think about what we really need in the shed and what can be donated, disposed of, or stored away somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Organise Your Shed True Blue Sheds</strong></p><p><br />Yes, we&rsquo;ve all heard this so many times. It probably makes you want to scream out, &ldquo;I know this, it&rsquo;s obvious!&rdquo;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an age-old method though that works, but still gets ignored as it requires a little work.</p><p><br />Take all the regularly used items and organise them using a system reflecting how you use your garden shed.</p><p>Are you a gardener, or do you just use your shed for the typical items like the lawnmower, bikes and other items that have been forced out of the garage and basement?</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a gardener then get yourself lots of hanging hooks, shelving and storage containers. It makes organisation much easier when everything has its place.</p><p>Soil, compost and seeds can all be kept in containers and if the size permits, on shelves.</p><p><br />Planters and flower pots can be stacked and placed on shelving - hanging baskets can be hung from the hooks.</p><p>If your shed has rafters, get a couple sheets of plywood and install them up there - then keep a ladder handy (hanging on the wall works well), and you can store the items you&rsquo;re only going to be using when you&rsquo;re first planting, saving you precious space.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re just a storage shed kind of person, then add shelving above the space where your lawnmower goes. If space is really tight, and you&rsquo;re physically able, get some large hooks and when you push your lawnmower into the shed, tilt it up and hook the handle onto the bike-storage hooks, reducing the footprint of the mower for bikes or other large items.

There are some really great storage systems on the market to help make the most of the traditionally unused upper space of your shed.</p><p><br />For those of us looking for something simpler, and have rafters to work with, get some simple plywood sheeting from the local home improvement centre, and mount them on the top of the rafters.<br />You&rsquo;ll need to either create a built-in ladder or keep a step ladder hanging on the wall close by for easy access. Up here you can place lightweight but large items such as planters, backyard torches, basically anything you can manage to get up there on a ladder.</p><p>Another simple and cheap way to create overhead storage space is by using screw-in hooks in the underside of your rafters and then suspending equal lengths of steel chain.</p><p><br />Attach a large piece of plywood to the ends of the chains with some S hooks, you&rsquo;ll have a place for anything that you can lift up there.</p><br><br><p><a href="https://homimprov.blob.core.windows.net/123/best-sheds.html">True Blue Sheds</a><br> <a href="https://homimprov.blob.core.windows.net/123/best-sheds.html">truebluesheds.com.au</a><br> <a href="https://homimprov.blob.core.windows.net/123/best-sheds.html">best sheds</a><br> <a href="https://homimprov.blob.core.windows.net/123/best-sheds.html">sheds for sale</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
