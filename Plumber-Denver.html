Uncertain how to make certain your heating system is on? Inspect the primary circuit breaker or electrical panel in your house.</p><p>Next go to where your furnace is located, you ought to see a switch close by, likewise make certain this is on. Locate your thermostat and ensure it is set to "HEAT" If it is not then the heating system will never kick on. Decide the perfect temperature level for your home, set your thermostat to that temperature level and then await the heater to kick on.</p><p>If the batteries are low or dead the thermostat can't function and for that reason can not tell the heating system to turn on. Open the cover and change the batteries. This is something you can do 2X annually when you change the batteries in your smoke alarm too. Was there just recently a power rise or a blown fuse? If so your heater may have powered down as a result.</p><p>Keep in mind that some heaters have their own devoted electrical panel, it needs to be clearly marked and all you need to do is find the panel and turn it on. Gas Heating systems have a pilot light. If the pilot light is not lit the heater will not work. Merely re-light the pilot burner and the heater will begin working once again.</p><p>How to Light a Pilot Light Your heating system has a vent to the outside. In a heavy snow storm the snow can obstruct the vent and trigger the heater to stop working. Make sure your vent is clear of all snow, ice, and any other particles. If your heating system has a blower fan, make certain it is ON.</p><p>Right before winter is about to hit, make the effort to inspect your furnace and thermostat for all of the above problems so you can catch any problems before the furnace quits working.</p><p>Your heating system was built to last.
