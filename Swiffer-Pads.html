While we all love our Swiffer, it's far from cost-efficient since the wet pads and dry pads can be pretty expensive. Not only is the cost of the refill pads and mopping solution expensive, but it's also not the most eco-friendly option. We wanted to tell you about some of the best Swiffer Sweeper mop hacks available so that you can get the most out of your Swiffer Sweeper mop without breaking the bank.</p><p>Swiffer Sweeper WetJet Hacks</p><p>Make a Homemade Cleaning Solution- One of the best hacks we can give you when it comes to the Swiffer WetJet is that it's a lot cheaper to make a homemade cleaning solution. The hardest part is going to be getting the cap off of the solution bottle since Swiffer tries to make it almost impossible to refill them.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Pads-Swiffer-Sweeper-Mops/dp/B087V8JHSD"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81A%2B6ZwY3ZL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="422" /></a></p><p>It's best to make the cleaning solution first which is done by grabbing a cup or other container with a pour spout so you can pour without a mess. Measure out 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of water and pour it into the cup or container. Drop about four drops of dishwashing liquid in to finish the cleaning solution.</p><p>You will need to grab a pot and fill it with water and boil the water on top of the stove so that it's boiling. Once it's boiling you need to take the solution bottle and turn it upside down so that the cap is submerged completely in the boiling water. Hold it in there for about 90 seconds then use a rag to open the bottle. With the lid off, you will be able to pour your cleaning solution into the Swiffer WetJet solution bottle and that's all you do! Close the cap and place the solution bottle back on your WetJet to begin cleaning with a homemade solution that works just as well.</p><p>Use Microfiber Cleaning Cloths- As you know, the WetJet pads are expensive and also seems wasteful since you can go through several just in one area of your house. It's much better and just as clean if you use a microfiber cleaning cloth instead. You can get packs of microfiber cloths for a few bucks and you can just insert a cleaning cloth into the grooves where you would secure the WetJet pads. The best part is that you can wash and reuse the microfiber cloths. This is a hack that not many people think of but it's a lot more budget-friendly than purchasing the tubs of refill pads all of the time.</p>						 </p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>Mop Pads More info</h2><br>																		<br />Swiffer Sweeper Dry Mop Hacks<br />Use Fuzzy Socks Instead of Sweeper Pads- Just like with the WetJet, the packs of Swiffer Sweeper dry mop refills are expensive. One way to get around the cost is to use fuzzy socks instead and they work rather well for cleaning all kinds of surfaces. Fuzzy socks are similar to the dry pads in terms of material so the fuzzy socks will work just as well to get lint and dust from the floor or ceiling fans.</p><p>All you do is take a fuzzy sock and stretch it over the bottom of the Swiffer so that the sock fits around it snugly. You'll notice that hair, dirt, dust, and lint are all picked up with the fuzzy sock and there's no expense to speak of either. You can wash and reuse the fuzzy sock as many times as you'd like and once it starts to fall apart, just go buy another $2 pair of socks.</p><p>Flip the Swiffer Pad for More Use- One thing you can do with the dry Swiffer pads is flip it over to get another use out of each pad. If you prefer to buy the pads, then flipping it over and using the backside to clean is a great way to get more bang for your buck. Instead of a pack of pads lasting you a month, you can get two months out of the pack just by using the other side of the dry pad to clean. As long as the pad isn't incredibly dirty, this is a hack that will help you out.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDqoLFkoeVM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Use Generic Wet or Dry Pads Instead- Whether we're talking about the Swiffer Sweeper wet or dry, a piece of advice is to check out generic pads. Swiffer Sweeper has been around for many years, which means that generic brands of these popular pads have popped up all over the place. You'll find that a lot of companies have their version of the Swiffer Sweeper pad available. These generic refill pads work just as well as the original pads but often are about half the price. If a store near you doesn't sell them then just hop online and you'll find so many options available that will save you so much money in the long run.See more about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Pads-Swiffer-Sweeper-Mops/dp/B087V8JHSD"> Reusable Swiffer</a></p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3></h3>                        <p>                    </footer>                </article>                           </div> <!-- #main -->        </div> <!-- #main-container -->                <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/vendor/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>        </body><br></html><br><br><p><a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">swiffer sweeper mop</a><br> <a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">swiffer pads</a><br> <a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">reusable swiffer</a><br> <a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">reusable sweeper pads</a><br> <a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">amazon find</a><br> <a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">turbo mops</a><br> <a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">sweeper mop pads</a><br> <a href="https://homimpv3.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Swiffer-Sweeper-Mop.html">mop pads</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
